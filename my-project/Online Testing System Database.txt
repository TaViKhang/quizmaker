Online Testing System Database
1. Database Structure
The system is built on a robust PostgreSQL database with the following key tables:
1.	users: Stores user information and authentication details
2.	accounts: Manages OAuth provider accounts for users
3.	sessions: Tracks user sessions for secure access
4.	verification_tokens: Handles email verification process
5.	quizzes: Stores quiz metadata and settings
6.	questions: Contains individual questions for each quiz
7.	options: Stores answer options for multiple-choice questions
8.	quiz_attempts: Tracks each attempt a user makes on a quiz
9.	answers: Records user responses for each question in an attempt
10.	certificates: Manages certificates issued for successful quiz completions
2. Key Features
2.1 User Management
•	Secure user authentication with email/password and OAuth support
•	Role-based access control (admin, instructor, student)
•	Email verification for new user accounts
2.2 Quiz Creation and Management
•	Instructors can create and manage quizzes
•	Support for multiple question types (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer)
•	Customizable quiz settings (time limit, passing score, attempt limits)
•	Option to randomize question order
2.3 Quiz Taking
•	Students can attempt quizzes multiple times (based on settings)
•	Timed quizzes with automatic submission
•	Instant feedback on quiz completion
2.4 Result Analysis
•	Detailed tracking of each quiz attempt
•	Score calculation and pass/fail determination
•	Certificate generation for successful completions
3. System Performance
3.1 Database Optimization
•	Use of UUIDs for primary keys to ensure uniqueness and improve scalability
•	Indexing on frequently queried columns for faster data retrieval
•	Proper use of foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
3.2 Security Measures
•	Token-based authentication for sessions
•	OAuth integration for third-party authentication
4. Key Dependencies:
•	Users are the central entity that interact with the rest of the system. They can create quizzes, take quiz attempts, and have associated OAuth accounts.
•	Quizzes contain Questions, which in turn have Options for multiple-choice questions.
•	QuizAttempts are linked to Users and Quizzes, and contain Answers that reference Questions and Options.
•	Certificates are generated for successful QuizAttempts.
•	VerificationTokens are used to confirm user email addresses during registration.
•	Sessions manage user authentication and authorization.

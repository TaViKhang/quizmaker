UI/UX Design Specification: Non-profit Online Testing System

Objective: To design a user-friendly, accessible, and performant online testing system for a non-profit organization, inspired by the aesthetics of Deel.com and the functionality of ClassMarker.com.

Target Audience: Educators, students, and administrators involved in educational assessment.

Key Principles:

Clean and Modern Aesthetic: Inspired by Deel.com's minimalist design, utilizing ample whitespace, clear typography, and a visually appealing hierarchy. Avoid sharp corners and overly angular elements for a softer, more approachable look.

Intuitive Navigation: Implement a clear and logical menu structure based on ClassMarker's functionality, enabling users to easily access different sections of the platform (e.g., creating tests, managing results, accessing reports).

User-Friendly Interface: Design all interactions to be simple, straightforward, and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise. Forms should be easy to complete, feedback should be clear and immediate, and help resources readily available.

Performance and Accessibility: Ensure fast loading times and responsiveness across all devices. Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities.

ClassMarker.com Branding: Utilize ClassMarker's color palette and visual style to maintain consistency with the existing platform. Images and graphics should clearly represent online testing scenarios.

Specific Features & Design Considerations:

Homepage/Landing Page: A compelling hero section highlighting the platform's benefits for non-profit educational use. Clear call-to-actions for account creation, demos, and exploring features. Showcase key statistics and testimonials (if available).

Test Creation Interface: User-friendly tools for creating various question types (multiple choice, essay, etc.), setting time limits, and configuring test parameters.

Test-Taking Interface: Clean and distraction-free environment for students. Clear progress indicators, timer display, and easy navigation between questions.

Results and Reporting: Comprehensive reporting features allowing educators to track student performance, analyze results, and generate customized reports.

Administrative Dashboard: Tools for user management, test management, and system configuration.

Integration with Educational Platforms: Explore potential integration options with popular learning management systems (LMS) if feasible.
